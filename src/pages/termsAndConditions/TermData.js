    question: "FAQs:",
    answer:
      "What is a trademark?\nA trademark could be said to be a word, design, logo or a symbol or a combination of the same that a company uses to identify its goods or services to enable customers and the public at large to distinguish the goods and services of that company from other companies’ goods and services. Trademark plays a vital role in preventing customer confusion by clearly indicating that the goods or services offered belongs only to the registered proprietor of the trademark.\nWhat does trademark law protect?\nTrademark law protects the reputation and goodwill of the registered proprietors of the trademark by deterring non-permitted users from using the trademark of the proprietor. The aim of trademark law is to prevent customer confusion which is guaranteed by distinguishing goods and services of one registered proprietor from another entity’s goods and services. The registration of a mark provides the owner of the mark the exclusive usage of the mark to the exclusion of the public. A trademark owner might be able to stop others from using a particular mark, which is deceptively similar or identical with the registered mark, if using the mark is likely to cause a customer to be confused about whether the product being sold is the trademark owner’s product.\nWhere are trademarks displayed on detail pages?\nTrademarks are majorly displayed on Jozzby bazar’s product detail pages in the form of product and brand names listed on a product detail page. If the brand name is not found in the detail page, the trademark could be found in the seller details once the buyer clicks on the said product.\nDo I always need the rights owner’s permission to use a trademark in the creation of a product detail page?\nNo, merely because you are not the owner of a trademark, that by itself does not denote that you cannot sell another entity’s goods. The trademark law entails that mere dealing with goods of a registered proprietor of a trademark would not amount to infringement unless the said person deals with goods of another person as his/her goods. Usually, the unauthorized use of a trademark in the creation of a detail page is infringing only if it is likely to cause confusion as to the source, endorsement, or affiliation of the goods.\nAs a seller, when can I use someone else’s trademark in the creation of a product detail page?\nGenerally, a seller can use someone else’s trademark in the following circumstances:\nWhen selling authentic goods, a seller may use a trademarked name only during trade where he/she discloses expressly that the goods belong to the registered proprietor and not otherwise; (permissible only because the seller is using the trademark to identify an authentic product)\nWhen using a trademarked word in its ordinary dictionary meaning.\nWhen making genuine and bona fide statements that a product is compatible with a trademarked product.\nis Counterfeiting?\nCounterfeiting is a type of trademark infringement, where a person unlawfully causes reproduction of a registered trademark, or a mark that is very similar to a registered trademark, in connection with the sale of a product that does not come from the trademark holder but appears as if it has been produced by the registered proprietor. It is necessary to use the registered trademark on the product or packaging. Who can report violations of the policy? Jozzby bazar shall take suo moto cognizance of any trademark infringements or it shall investigate requests that are submitted or reported by the trademark holder, their authorized representatives, by the buyers of the products sold on this website.\nif I did not know I was violating/had violated someone’s intellectual property?\nSellers are expected to comply with all the Acts, Regulations, Rules, and policies laid down by the Government of India and are also expected to adhere to Jozzby Bazar’s policies. Jozzby Bazar takes cognizance and claims of intellectual property infringement seriously. Even if it is found that a seller is infringing on someone’s intellectual property without knowledge, we will still act and the seller’s account might receive a warning or be suspended. You should consult an attorney for help to ensure that your business has the right procedures in place to prevent IP infringement.\nSteps to be taken if your account receives a warning or suspension pertaining to trademark infringement.\nIf you believe that a rights owner, or Jozzby bazar, has made an error when removing your product listing on the grounds of counterfeiting or trademark infringement, then please reply to the notification that you have received and provide specific reasons as to why you believe a mistake was made. You are advised to furnish copies of invoices or an Order ID (if any) which demonstrates the authenticity of the product in question.
